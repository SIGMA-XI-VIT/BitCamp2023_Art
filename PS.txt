Title: Art Authentication and Copyright Protection

Description:
Forgery and copyright infringement are common issues in the art world. While blockchain technology has the potential to create secure, transparent, and tamper-proof records of art ownership and provenance, there's a need for user-friendly tools that allow artists and collectors to easily register and verify their art on blockchain networks.
Develop a user-friendly blockchain-based application that enables artists and collectors to register their artworks securely. This application should include features like easy onboarding, digital certificates of authenticity, and a user-friendly interface for verifying the provenance of art pieces. Implement smart contracts to automate royalty payments to artists whenever their work is resold.
